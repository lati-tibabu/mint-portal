                <p>The MinT was established in 2019 by merging the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Ministry
                    of Communication and Information Technology. The merger was a recognition of the importance of
                    innovation and technology to Ethiopia's future, and it has allowed the MinT to better coordinate its
                    efforts to promote innovation and technology across the country.
